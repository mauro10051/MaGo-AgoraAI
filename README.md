# 🧠 MaGo AgoraAI

**From a single question, generate concept maps, simulated interviews, interdisciplinary dialogues, and academic theses.**  
🎯 *The first AI-powered engine for interdisciplinary academic debates.*

---

## ⚡ What It Does

Imagine asking, “What is time?” and receiving in just 40 minutes:

- 📚 Two master-level papers (e.g., relativistic physics vs. philosophy of time), complete with bibliography.
- 🗺️ Concept maps bridging both disciplines.
- 🎤 A structured debate where AI agents embody opposing perspectives with academic-level arguments.

---

## 🚀 Why It's Innovative

- 🔥 No other tool combines multidisciplinary research, academic synthesis, and automated dialectics.
- ⚡ From a single question to complex academic papers — in under an hour.
- 🧠 Works offline with open-source LLMs (via Ollama).

## 🧩 Core Features

- Guided creation with definition of the initial question and agent expertise.
- Automatic generation of **concept maps** (Max & Samanta).
- Moderated evaluation of contributions (Pol).
- Simulated **interdisciplinary interviews and dialogues**.
- Generation of **academic-level texts** (essays, course materials, analyses).
- 💻 Works locally: **Python + Ollama + Gemma 3 (12B)**.

## 🧠 Dialogical Approach

At the heart of AgoraAI lies a multi-agent conversation:

- **Max** – expert in one discipline (e.g., physics)
- **Samanta** – expert in another (e.g., philosophy)
- **Pol** – the moderator who synthesizes and guides

This enables emergent, high-level academic discourse from a single prompt.
