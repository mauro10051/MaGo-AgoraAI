## 🔍 What is MaGo‑AgoraAI?

MaGo‑AgoraAI is an innovative **multi-agent educational engine** that generates:

- 🧠 **Simulated debates** with 3–4 academic-level AI agents  
- 🗺️ **Concept maps** and question-driven interviews  
- 📘 **Multilingual essays** with cooperative writing logic  
- 🧪 Agents that can become *objects* (e.g., a photon or water molecule) or *commentators* (e.g., Zen agent using koans)  

All this from a **single question**, entirely offline.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- Multi-agent reasoning from different disciplines  
- Tutor agents that simplify or clarify complex answers  
- Role-playing agents that embody concepts, forces, or metaphors  
- Zen agent that adds metaphorical/poetic insights after each step  
- Output can reach **120K tokens** in deep interviews or debates  
- Uses [Gemma 12B](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) locally via Ollama

## 💡 Why It’s Different

While many recent multi-agent frameworks focus on **task coordination** (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph), MaGo‑AgoraAI focuses on **dialectical depth and plural reasoning**.

Its originality lies in:

- Cooperative generation of **rich, nuanced texts**
- Dialogue as method (not just tool) for reasoning
- Hybrid agents (academic + narrative + metaphorical)
- Focus on **local execution**, usable in education, research, and cognitive simulation

## 🧠 Agents & Dialogical Model

The core architecture revolves around dialogue:

| Agent   | Role                                        |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| Max     | Expert 1 (e.g., physics, engineering)       |
| Samanta | Expert 2 (e.g., philosophy, sociology)      |
| Pol     | Moderator and synthesizer                   |
| Alice   | Role-player agent (e.g., photon, cell)      |
| Zen     | Adds metaphorical/poetic koans              |
| TutorX  | Clarifies or simplifies complex concepts    |
