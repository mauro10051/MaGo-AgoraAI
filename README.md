# 🎓 MaGo AgoraAI – A Cooperative AI Lesson Engine  
_A Role-Based, Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Collaborative Learning_

---

### ✨ What is MaGo-AgoraAI?

**MaGo-AgoraAI** is an experimental AI framework that moves beyond flat, monologic text generation. It proposes a **dialogic and cooperative approach** to knowledge construction — inspired by Socratic dialectics and interdisciplinary scientific debate.

Through simulated interaction between **epistemic agents** (e.g., physicist, philosopher, artist), and guided by a **reflective moderator** (Pol), the system generates rich, structured, and explanatory texts rooted in academic rigor and interdisciplinary synthesis.

---

## 🎯 What Makes It Unique?

- 💡 **Depth over surface** – multilayered reasoning, not mere summarization  
- 🧭 **Iterative cycles** – questions, answers, synthesis, reflection  
- 🧠 **Cooperative reasoning** – agents revise and converge, simulating learning  
- 📚 **Academic clarity** – structured output that explains, not just informs  
- 🧩 **Interdisciplinary by design** – real interaction across domains

---

## 🧪 What Does It Produce?

Starting from a user-defined **central question**, MaGo-AgoraAI generates:

- 🗺️ A **conceptual map** and expert agenda  
- 🎤 **Two interviews** with agents (e.g., Max the physicist, Samanta the philosopher)  
- 🤝 A **collaborative dialogue**, where insights converge or clash  
- 🧾 A final **synthesis**, authored by the moderator (Pol), distilling the session  

The result is not a static lecture nor a chaotic chat — but a **guided epistemic journey**, blending perspectives to deepen understanding.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- 🧠 Agents are **role-based LLMs**, each with domain-specific reasoning  
- 🤖 The moderator (Pol) drives the conversation, evaluates answers, and refines questions  
- 🪜 Each cycle builds upon the previous, enabling **second-order learning**

This architecture — even when powered by compact models like **Gemma 3B** — achieves results comparable to larger LLMs thanks to its **modular design** and **semantic choreography**.
