# 🏩 MaGo AgoraAI

Where artificial minds debate like scholars of antiquity.

MaGo AgoraAI: An Experiment in Applied Epistemology for Artificial Intelligence  👉 [Read the full abstract in English](./docs/abstract.md)

Starting from a single question, AgoraAI generates concept maps, simulates interviews, lectures, and interdisciplinary academic debates between artificial agents.

MaGo-AgoraAI is an innovative system that leverages the power of dialogue between specialized agents to build knowledge at successive levels. Starting from simple questions and answers, the system progressively generates conceptual maps, structured outlines, in-depth interviews, and expert debates, ultimately resulting in complete and coherent university-level theses. Each phase of the process is fueled by the interaction between differentiated roles, creating a continuous enhancement ecosystem that improves the quality and depth of responses through mutual collaboration and correction. A system that goes beyond the simple "outcome" of a question, building dynamic and scalable knowledge.

## 🧪 Project Abstract & Philosophy

> “A good argument doesn’t end the search for truth — it opens new paths toward understanding.”

**Why MaGo AgoraAI?**  
This project explores whether cooperative internal agents in LLMs can simulate higher-order reasoning, approaching the performance of larger models without fine-tuning or architectural changes. It merges epistemological reflection with practical LLM prompting.

### 🔬 Context

When you ask a question to a generative model, the quality of the answer depends on architecture and size. Instead of changing the model itself, this project explores *internal dialogue* as a method to enhance performance.

### 🎯 Goal

To test whether internal cooperative agents (simulated via prompting) can improve clarity, depth, and interdisciplinarity in models like **Gemma 3 12B**, simulating the effect of "thinking together".

### 🧪 Method

We created a dialogic engine within **Ollama** running on RTX 4070 using **Gemma 3 12B**.  
Three roles were simulated:

- **Pol** – Moderator  
- **Max** – Physicist  
- **Samanta** – Philosopher

Key outputs:

- Concept maps  
- Agent profile refinement  
- Simulated lectures/interviews  
- Structured debates  
- Dialectical synthesis

### 📈 Results

Compared to standard prompts, the cooperative-agent setup generates:
- Higher coherence
- Better articulation of reasoning
- Emergence of new ideas

Small models (e.g., 7B) fail to reproduce this behavior, confirming that **emergent cooperation** appears only beyond a complexity threshold.

### 🔍 Hypothesis

Internal agent interaction may act as a **low-entropy attractor** — organizing knowledge via local feedback loops and mimicking early forms of **self-organizing cognition**.

This could be interpreted as *simulated autopoiesis* — an artificial mind structuring its own internal order through dialogue.
