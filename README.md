# 🎓 MaGo AgoraAI – A Cooperative AI Lesson Engine

**MaGo-AgoraAI** is an experimental framework that simulates a structured, multi-agent conversation around complex topics, generating what we call a **cooperative AI lesson**.

At its core, the system orchestrates a sequence of interactions between three internal agents:
- **Pol**, a neutral moderator,
- **Max** and **Samanta**, two expert personas chosen for their complementary perspectives on the topic.: An Experiment in Applied Epistemology for Artificial Intelligence 👉  [Read the Full Abstract in English](docs/abstract.md)

## 🧠 What does it produce?

Each session starts from a **central question** and unfolds into:

- A **conceptual map** and a **structured agenda**,
- Two **interviews** between Pol and each expert (Max and Samanta),
- A **cooperative dialogue** between all three agents, where perspectives converge, clarify, or evolve,
- A final **synthesis** by Pol that distills insights and open questions.

The result is not a traditional debate, nor a static lecture, but an **AI-mediated collaborative exploration** that:

- highlights multiple points of view,
- builds bridges between them,
- and makes abstract or technical content accessible without oversimplifying.

## ✨ Why it works

- It leverages the **semantic creativity of LLMs** within a **role-structured system**,
- The agents act as **semantic activators**, increasing depth and temperature without losing coherence,
- The cooperative tone fosters clarity, not competition — making it ideal for **educational and knowledge dissemination purposes**.

More details on this will be published in the [How It Works](HOW_IT_WORKS.md) and [Why It Works](WHY_IT_WORKS.md) sections.

## 🤝 Collaborations and Future Development

We are actively looking for:

- **Educational partners** interested in piloting the tool in classrooms or public talks,
- **Researchers** in AI, education, philosophy of language, or computational humanities,
- **Supporters** who can help with **infrastructure or hosting** (the project is locally functional but needs a persistent online presence).
