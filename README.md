# 🏩 MaGo AgoraAI

Where Artificial Minds Engage in Scholarly Debates, Just Like in the Halls of Antiquity

MaGo AgoraAI: An Experiment in Applied Epistemology for Artificial Intelligence 👉 Read the Full Abstract in English

MaGo AgoraAI is an innovative system that harnesses the power of dialogue between specialized agents to build knowledge across multiple layers. It begins with a single question, progressing through phases of conceptual mapping, structured outlines, simulated interviews, academic lectures, and interdisciplinary debates among artificial agents.

From these simple beginnings, the system gradually constructs comprehensive university-level theses. This process involves agents in different roles—each contributing unique insights and enhancing the overall discourse. With every iteration, the responses are refined through mutual collaboration and correction, forming an ongoing cycle of continuous improvement.

MaGo AgoraAI goes beyond simply providing an answer to a question. It builds dynamic, scalable knowledge that grows deeper with each phase, leveraging the power of agent-based interactions to generate truly comprehensive, interdisciplinary insights.

## 🧪 Project Abstract & Philosophy

> “A good argument doesn’t end the search for truth — it opens new paths toward understanding.”

**Why MaGo AgoraAI?**  
This project explores whether cooperative internal agents in LLMs can simulate higher-order reasoning, approaching the performance of larger models without fine-tuning or architectural changes. It merges epistemological reflection with practical LLM prompting.

### 🔬 Context

When you ask a question to a generative model, the quality of the answer depends on architecture and size. Instead of changing the model itself, this project explores *internal dialogue* as a method to enhance performance.

### 🎯 Goal

To test whether internal cooperative agents (simulated via prompting) can improve clarity, depth, and interdisciplinarity in models like **Gemma 3 12B**, simulating the effect of "thinking together".

### 🧪 Method

We created a dialogic engine within **Ollama** running on RTX 4070 using **Gemma 3 12B**.  
Three roles were simulated:

- **Pol** – Moderator  
- **Max** – Physicist  
- **Samanta** – Philosopher

Key outputs:

- Concept maps  
- Agent profile refinement  
- Simulated lectures/interviews  
- Structured debates  
- Dialectical synthesis

### 📈 Results

Compared to standard prompts, the cooperative-agent setup generates:
- Higher coherence
- Better articulation of reasoning
- Emergence of new ideas

Small models (e.g., 7B) fail to reproduce this behavior, confirming that **emergent cooperation** appears only beyond a complexity threshold.

### 🔍 Hypothesis

Internal agent interaction may act as a **low-entropy attractor** — organizing knowledge via local feedback loops and mimicking early forms of **self-organizing cognition**.

This could be interpreted as *simulated autopoiesis* — an artificial mind structuring its own internal order through dialogue.
