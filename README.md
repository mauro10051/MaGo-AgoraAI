## ⚡ What It Does

Imagine asking, “What is time?” and receiving in just 40 minutes:

- 📚 Two master-level papers (e.g., relativistic physics vs. philosophy of time), complete with bibliography.  
- 🗺️ Concept maps bridging both disciplines.  
- 🎤 A structured debate where AI agents embody opposing perspectives with academic-level arguments.

---

## 🚀 Why It's Innovative

- 🔥 No other tool combines multidisciplinary research, academic synthesis, and automated dialectics.  
- ⚡ From a single question to complex academic papers — in under an hour.  
- 🧠 Works offline with open-source LLMs (via Ollama).

---

## 🧩 Core Features

- Guided creation with definition of the initial question and agent expertise.  
- Automatic generation of **concept maps** (Max & Samanta).  
- Moderated evaluation of contributions (Pol).  
- Simulated **interdisciplinary interviews and dialogues**.  
- Generation of **academic-level texts** (essays, course materials, analyses).  
- 💻 Works locally: **Python + Ollama + Gemma 3 (12B)**.

---

## 🧠 Dialogical Approach

At the heart of AgoraAI lies a multi-agent conversation:

- **Max** – expert in one discipline (e.g., physics)  
- **Samanta** – expert in another (e.g., philosophy)  
- **Pol** – the moderator who synthesizes and guides  

This enables emergent, high-level academic discourse from a single prompt.

## 🖥️ Desktop App (v1.0)

AgoraAI is also available as a **standalone desktop app**.

> Designed to generate concept maps, cooperative dialogues, and academic texts from a simple question.  
> Accessible, flexible, and powerful – for both education and advanced research.

---

## 🧪 Use Case Examples

- Philosophy of mind vs. quantum physics  
- AI ethics vs. computer engineering  
- History vs. neuroscience  

> You define the viewpoints and the initial question.  
> The system generates rigorous, consistent content.

## 📦 Main Libraries

- [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) – for running LLMs locally  
- Python: `tkinter`, file management, PDF generation, etc.
