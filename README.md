# 🧠 MaGo AgoraAI

From a single question, generate concept maps, simulated interviews, interdisciplinary dialogues, and academic theses.
## 🎯 The first AI-powered engine for interdisciplinary academic debates.

Imagine asking, “What is time?” and receiving in just 40 minutes:

    📚 Two master-level papers (e.g., relativistic physics vs. philosophy of time), complete with bibliography.

    🗺️ Concept maps bridging both disciplines.

    ⚡ A structured debate where AI agents embody opposing perspectives with academic-level arguments.

## Why is it innovative?

    🔥 No other tool combines multidisciplinary research, academic synthesis, and automated dialectics.

    🚀 From question to complex academic paper in under an hour – ready for human review.

## 🚀 Core Features

    Guided project creation with definition of the initial question and agent expertise.

    Automatic generation of concept maps (by Max and Samanta).

    Evaluation of contributions via a moderator (Pol).

    Simulated interviews and dialogues between agents with different viewpoints.

    Generation of academic-level texts (essays, course materials, interdisciplinary analyses).

    ⚙️ Technologies: Python + Ollama + Gemma 3 (12B) model.
    Compatible with other medium-sized open-source LLMs.

## 🧩 Dialogical Approach

The core of AgoraAI is the interaction between **simulated agents**:

- **Max** – an expert in a specific discipline (e.g., theoretical physics).
- **Samanta** – an expert in another discipline (e.g., philosophy).
- **Pol** – the moderator who synthesizes, evaluates, and guides the discussion.

This approach enables the system to **develop complex** and **interdisciplinary elaborations**, even with a single defined viewpoint.

## 🖥️ Desktop Interface

AgoraAI is also available as a desktop application. Below are two versions:

### ✅ Version 1 (public)

Allows users to create projects, generate concept maps, and view evaluations. It is designed to be simple, accessible, and usable in educational settings.

![Version 1](images/Vers_1.png)  
*Simplified interface with basic functions: suitable for all users.*

---

### 🔒 Version 2 (full)

Advanced version with additional features, currently not publicly available:

- Generation of **scientific profiles**, **simulated interviews**, and **cooperative dialogues**.
- Production of **lectures and academic texts** on any topic.
- Extreme flexibility: even a single initial viewpoint can trigger the entire process.

![Version 2](images/Vers_2.png)  
*Complete interface for creating master's level texts from a single question.*

## 📦 Main Libraries

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) – to run LLM models locally.
- Standard Python libraries for GUI (e.g., `tkinter`), file management, PDF, etc.

---

## 🧪 Use Case Examples

- Philosophy of mind and quantum physics.
- AI ethics and computer engineering.
- History and neuroscience.

The user defines the viewpoints and the initial question. The system then automatically generates consistent and in-depth content.

---

## 📂 Future Projects

- Release of the full version with dialogue memory management.
- Integration with web frontend.
- Advanced customization features for agents and disciplinary domains.
