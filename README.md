#🚀 AgoraAI v1.0 – Optimized Version Now Available!
🎉 The first official version has evolved: lighter, more accessible, and smarter.

👉 [Download AgoraAI v1.0 (.exe)]

🧠 Runs 100% locally with Ollama + Gemma 3B/12B models (and now also smaller, lighter models tested for excellent results).
No cloud, no APIs, no tokens.
🔧 Key updates:

    ⚙️ General performance optimizations

    🧩 Access to smaller models: tested and selected for great results even on older hardware

    💻 Extended compatibility: now works on RTX 2000 series GPUs

    🖨️ Fixed a PDF printing conflict: documents are now accessible in Markdown and HTML formats

    🧭 New intelligent start option: you can now begin not only by asking a question, but also by describing a problem.
    From this, model agents autonomously generate the initial question and expert viewpoints to start the study path.

📌 AgoraAI is your cognitive dialogue space: an offline platform to explore ideas, solve problems, and simulate expert perspectives.

🧪 Experiment. Compare. Deepen.

## 🔍 What is MaGo‑AgoraAI?

MaGo‑AgoraAI is an innovative **multi-agent educational engine** that generates:

- 🧠 **Simulated debates** with 3–4 academic-level AI agents  
- 🗺️ **Concept maps** and question-driven interviews  
- 📘 **Multilingual essays** with cooperative writing logic  
- 🧪 Agents that can become *objects* (e.g., a photon or water molecule) or *commentators* (e.g., Zen agent using koans)  

All this from a **single question**, entirely offline.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- Multi-agent reasoning from different disciplines  
- Tutor agents that simplify or clarify complex answers  
- Role-playing agents that embody concepts, forces, or metaphors  
- Zen agent that adds metaphorical/poetic insights after each step  
- Output can reach **120K tokens** in deep interviews or debates  
- Uses [Gemma 12B](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) locally via Ollama

---

## 💡 Why It’s Different

While many recent multi-agent frameworks focus on **task coordination** (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph), MaGo‑AgoraAI focuses on **dialectical depth and plural reasoning**.

Its originality lies in:

- Cooperative generation of **rich, nuanced texts**
- Dialogue as method (not just tool) for reasoning
- Hybrid agents (academic + narrative + metaphorical)
- Focus on **local execution**, usable in education, research, and cognitive simulation

## 🧠 Agents & Dialogical Model

The core architecture revolves around dialogue:

| Agent   | Role                                        |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| Max     | Expert 1 (e.g., physics, engineering)       |
| Samanta | Expert 2 (e.g., philosophy, sociology)      |
| Pol     | Moderator and synthesizer                   |
| Alice   | Role-player agent (e.g., photon, cell)      |
| Zen     | Adds metaphorical/poetic koans              |
| TutorX  | Clarifies or simplifies complex concepts    |
