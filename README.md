# 🧠 MaGo AgoraAI

From a single question, generate concept maps, simulated interviews, interdisciplinary dialogues, and academic theses.
## 🎯 The first AI-powered engine for interdisciplinary academic debates.

Imagine asking, “What is time?” and receiving in just 40 minutes:

    📚 Two master-level papers (e.g., relativistic physics vs. philosophy of time), complete with bibliography.

    🗺️ Concept maps bridging both disciplines.

    ⚡ A structured debate where AI agents embody opposing perspectives with academic-level arguments.

## Why is it innovative?

    🔥 No other tool combines multidisciplinary research, academic synthesis, and automated dialectics.

    🚀 From question to complex academic paper in under an hour – ready for human review.

## 🚀 Core Features

    Guided project creation with definition of the initial question and agent expertise.

    Automatic generation of concept maps (by Max and Samanta).

    Evaluation of contributions via a moderator (Pol).

    Simulated interviews and dialogues between agents with different viewpoints.

    Generation of academic-level texts (essays, course materials, interdisciplinary analyses).

    ⚙️ Technologies: Python + Ollama + Gemma 3 (12B) model.
    Compatible with other medium-sized open-source LLMs.

## 🧩 Dialogical Approach

The core of AgoraAI is the interaction between **simulated agents**:

- **Max** – an expert in a specific discipline (e.g., theoretical physics).
- **Samanta** – an expert in another discipline (e.g., philosophy).
- **Pol** – the moderator who synthesizes, evaluates, and guides the discussion.

This approach enables the system to **develop complex** and **interdisciplinary elaborations**, even with a single defined viewpoint.

## 🖥️ Desktop Interface

AgoraAI is also available as a desktop application. Below are two versions:

# 🧠 MaGo-AgoraAI

MaGo-AgoraAI is a tool designed to generate concept maps, cooperative dialogues, academic texts, and educational simulations starting from a simple initial question.  
It is intended to be **accessible**, **powerful**, and **flexible** — ideal both for classroom use and for advanced content generation.
