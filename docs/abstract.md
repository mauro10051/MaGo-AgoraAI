### _An Experiment in Applied Epistemology for Artificial Intelligence_

**MaGo AgoraAI** is a project that explores the ability of generative AI models to develop advanced cognitive behavior through the orchestration of **internal cooperative agents**.  
Using a model such as **Gemma 3:12b**, we built a dialogic framework involving a **Moderator (Pol)** and two domain experts from different disciplines ‚Äî **Max**, a physicist, and **Samanta**, a philosopher ‚Äî who collaborate to address a complex question.

The generated outputs include:
- **Text-based concept maps**  
- **Specialist lectures or interviews**  
- **Three-way debates**, moderated and progressively deepened

All texts are characterized by scientific rigor and educational potential, making them suitable for **learning and teaching contexts**.  
The project demonstrates that **agent cooperation** can function as a **cognitive amplifier**, even in relatively compact models, and helps create a **cognitive space** capable of simulating forms of evolved learning.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Methodology**

The three agents are activated starting from a central question, using a prompt-based structure designed to foster **constructive dialogue**. This process generates:

- **Concept maps** summarizing the debate  
- **Lectures/interviews** on specific topics  
- **Interdisciplinary discussions**, led by the moderator to elicit high-level synthesis

üîó The _Demo_ section provides sample questions, agent profiles, concept maps, lectures, and debates.  
üì¶ The _Download_ section offers a **Python demo** limited to the generation of textual concept maps.

### üìà **Results**

Tests conducted with **Gemma 3:12b** have shown a response quality **comparable to that of much larger models**.  
Agent interaction not only improves answer quality, but also introduces an **internal informational order** that simulates **second-order cognitive behavior**.

### üß© **Conclusions**

This experiment suggests that achieving cognitive leaps in AI **does not necessarily require exponential growth in model size**. Instead, it may depend on enhancing **internal dynamics**, such as agent cooperation.

This opens the door to the development of **more efficient, cognitively capable AI systems** that require fewer computational resources.
