# 🔍 MaGo AgoraAI  
### _An Experiment in Dialogical Intelligence and Applied Epistemology_

**MaGo-AgoraAI** is a research-driven framework designed to explore how lightweight language models can engage in structured, multi-agent dialogue to generate knowledge collaboratively.

Inspired by **Socratic dialectics** and **scientific debate**, the system simulates epistemic actors interacting through iterative cycles of questions, responses, synthesis, and revision — all orchestrated by a reasoning moderator.

## 🧠 Architecture

MaGo-AgoraAI leverages compact language models (e.g., *Gemma 3B*) arranged in a modular setup to simulate:

- 🧑‍🔬 **Distinct epistemic agents**: physicists, philosophers, mathematicians, artists, etc.  
- 🧑‍⚖️ **An intelligent moderator** (*Pol*), capable of summarizing, evaluating, and reformulating questions  
- 🔁 **An iterative loop** of dialogue aimed at co-constructing layered, interdisciplinary understanding

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🌐 Go beyond flat LLM generation with **multi-perspective, structured narratives**
- 🌀 Simulate **reflective learning processes** (second-order learning) through iterative moderation
- 📚 Produce **explanatory and argumentative texts** aligned with the epistemic profiles of the agents
- 🔧 Show that **small models** can be enhanced via **interaction-based architectures**

---

## 🚀 Current Features

- ✅ Autonomous generation of **concept maps**
- ✅ Full cycles of **questions, replies, and moderator synthesis**
- ✅ **Simulated interviews** and **multi-agent dialogues** on complex topics

## 📌 Case Studies Available

Several curated case studies are already available and can be downloaded from the [`src`](./src) folder:

- 🧭 *Physicist and Philosopher on the concept of time*  
- 🎼 *Musician and Physicist on sound and space*  
- 🧮 *Mathematician and Philosopher on abstraction*

📥 **Explore them, experiment with them — and let us know what you think!**

## 🧭 Roadmap

- 🖥️ Collaborative hosting with GPU acceleration  
- 🧩 Interactive frontend for composing prompts and managing debates  
- 📊 Automatic evaluation of argumentative quality and epistemic convergence  
- 💾 Versioning and dialog storage

## 📡 Call for Collaboration

We are actively seeking collaborators to help us take MaGo-AgoraAI to the next stage. If we cannot find supporters, this project may not go beyond the prototype phase — **your contribution matters!**

We need help in:

- ⚙️ **Backend development** & GPU-based hosting  
- 💻 **Web UI / UX** design and interaction layers  
- 🧠 **Qualitative analysis** of argumentation and conceptual maps  
- ⚖️ Contributions from **computational linguists, philosophers of science, and AI ethics experts**
