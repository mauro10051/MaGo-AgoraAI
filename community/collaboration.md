## 🌟 Collaborate or Support MaGo-AgoraAI

MaGo-AgoraAI is an innovative project for generating structured dialogues (interviews/debates) using LLMs.
🚀 Current priority: Secure powerful hosting (GPU RTX 4000+) and optimize costs for scalability!
🔥 Urgently Needed
### 1. Sponsors/Hosting Partners

    Challenge: The model requires RTX 4000+ GPUs (cannot run on low-cost cloud instances).

    Estimated cost: ~300−300−500/month for dedicated GPU servers (Lambda Labs, RunPod, etc.).

    What we offer:

        Logo/mention in the README and project website.

        Early access to new features.

2. Cloud & LLM Optimization Experts

    Tasks:

        Optimize the model (quantization, caching) to reduce costs.

        Implement serverless solutions (AWS Lambda + spot instances).
